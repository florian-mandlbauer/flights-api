This API provides real-time flight information from Austrian airports. Users can switch between six different airports and the date and time are dynamically calculated from the moment of accessing the site. It also displays whether the flights are on time or delayed. Clicking on a specific flight leads to a detail page with comprehensive flight information, weather conditions at the destination, and a picture of the destination.
